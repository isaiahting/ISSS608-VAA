In the private housing market, land ownership is divided into two parts: land and strata. For landed property, the plot of land belongs to the owner while in strata property, the plot of land is jointly owned by the legal owners in the same development ([The Business Times, 2022](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/landed-home-prices-set-stay-firm-if-not-trend-upwards)). A detached house, commonly known as bungalow, semi-detached house and terrace house may possess either be landed or strata titled.\n\n### 1.2. Objective\n\nIn this exercise, we aim to apply different data visualisation design practices and principles in improving on the Take-Home Exercise 1's output of a fellow coursemate\n\n## **Preparation**\n\nIn this section, we will be preparing our R environment and data set.\n\n### 2.1 Packages\n\nThe following functions will be loaded using **'pacman:p_load()'** in R Packages to facilitate the data preparation and analysis process.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Display Code\"}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse,dplyr, ggthemes,colorspace,ggiraph,\n               plotly,patchwork,lubridate, \n               ggrepel,ggdist)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 2.2 Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Display Code\"}\nq5data <- read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nA total of 4,902 rows and 21 columns.

The diagram of the coordinate system below will served as an overall assessment of the visualisation.\n\n![*Figure 1: Data Visualization: Clarity vs. Aesthetics*](pictures/Grid.webp){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![*Figure 2: The Product*](pictures/Rydia_Diagram.png)\n\n### 3.1. Overall\n\nThe design is elegant; is not bombarded with mouthful of information. It allows readers to examine the median transacted prices of each propery type in the type of area at a glance. The background colour is easy on the user's eyes; not too bright nor contrasting. Good consideration.\n\n### 3.2. Clarity\n\nIn the context of Jones (2012), the author defined clarity as \"how quickly and effectively it imparts to the audience an accurate understanding of some fundamental truth about the real world\". The two metrics that will be used in this section as per follows:\n\n1\\. At one glance, does it tell a story?\n\n2\\. Upon examination, Is it effective in telling me a story within the visulisation?\n\nComments:\n\na.  The dots that represents the median price of each property type is rather small. Audience may not effectively picked up the median price of the size of the dot\n\n    Solution: To increase dotsize\n\nb.  The lack of the actual median price being displayed beside the dot does not tell the audience\n\n    Solution: To indicate the average price beside the dot\n\nc.  The use of median prices might be one of the market's indicator for the transactions prices. However, average transacted prices is also an important market indicator despite its sensitivity to outlier transactions. Stakeholders such as potential buyers do want to know the average transacted price too as it may indicate they potentially need to purchase the property.\n\n    Solution: Box & Whisker plot will be introduced instead as the audience is able to clearly visualise the distribution of the transacted price. The box & whisker plot will reflect the following: 1. Lower & Upper Quantile 2. Minimum & Maximum Value 3. Outliers 4. Average price 5. Median price\n\n### 3.3. Aesthetic\n\nJones (2012) dictates that aesthetics should only be discussed once clarity has been achieved. In the previous section, shortfalls has been discussed alongside proposed solutions. Therefore, upon achieving clarity, aesthetics can be explored.\n\na.  The inverted words of the property type makes it difficult for the audience to comprehend each column. Solution:\n\nb.  Lack of title in this visualisation - Audience might not know which quarter or year this data was obtained from\n\n## **Product Realisation**\n\n### 4.1 Ideation\n\nA rough sketch of the box and whiskers plot has been made in facilitating the ideation process.\n\n![](pictures/Sketch.jpg)\n\n### 4.2 Blackboard\n\n*Attempt 1 - Clarity:*\n\nThe data was populated into a box and whiskers plot and the below plot was generated. Noticed that the plots appear compressed especially in Strata due to the presence of outlier transaction prices seen in the Detached House. Thus, in this instance, it is practical to remove these 2 outliers transactions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Display Code\"}\nggplot(q5data, aes(x = `Transacted Price ($)`, y = `Property Type`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(500000, 40500000), breaks = seq(500000, 40500000, 5000000), labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = \"$\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~`Type of Area`, ncol = 1, labeller = labeller(`Type of Area` = c(Strata = \"Strata\"))) +\n  labs(x = \"Transacted Price ($)\", y = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 8) +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TakeHomeEx02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Attempt 2 - Clarity:*\n\nBy limiting the x axis to \\$20,500,000, the two outlier transactions were removed. At a first glance, it is clear that there are no transactions of Executive Condomimium and Condominium within the Strata type. Additionally, there is only one transaction for 'Apartment' in Land and 'Detached House' in Strta.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Display Code\"}\nggplot(q5data, aes(x = `Transacted Price ($)`, y = `Property Type`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(500000, 20500000), breaks = seq(500000, 20500000, 5000000), labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = \"$\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~`Type of Area`, ncol = 1, labeller = labeller(`Type of Area` = c(Strata = \"Strata\"))) +\n  labs(x = \"Transacted Price ($)\", y = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 8) +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TakeHomeEx02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Attempt 3 - Clarity:*\n\nAn attempt has been made to allow the box and whiskers plot to be posiitoned vertically instead of horizontally as it may faciliate in assessing the trasanced price from lowest to the highest. However, the plot appeared compressed and might be secondary to orientation of the diagram. Hence the decision was made to retain the original plot as seen in Attempt 2.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Display Code\"}\nggplot(q5data, aes(x = `Property Type`, y = `Transacted Price ($)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(500000, 20500000), breaks = seq(500000, 20500000, 5000000), labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = \"$\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~`Type of Area`, ncol = 1, labeller = labeller(`Type of Area` = c(Strata = \"Strata\"))) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Transacted Price ($)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 8) +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TakeHomeEx02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Attempt 4 - Clarity:*\n\nIn ensuring the clarity, the average transacted prices for each property type has been added alongside the actual average transacted figure and in facilitating the flow of vision, the color \"blue\" has been used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Display Code\"}\nggplot(q5data, aes(x = `Transacted Price ($)`, y = `Property Type`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = \"point\", shape = 18, size = 2, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_text(data = mean_prices, aes(label = scales::dollar_format()(mean_price), y = `Property Type`, x = mean_price), vjust = 2, hjust= -0.5, size = 2.5, color=\"blue\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(500000, 20500000), breaks = seq(500000, 20500000, 5000000), labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = \"$\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~`Type of Area`, ncol = 1, labeller = labeller(`Type of Area` = c(Strata = \"Strata\"))) +\n  labs(x = \"Transacted Price ($)\", y = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 8) +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TakeHomeEx02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Attempt 5 - Aesthetics:*\n\nEach individual property type has been assigned a colour to faciliate viewing. The colour is consistent in both Land and Strata. For example: The use of red colour is standardised for Terrace House in Land and Strata type.

The visualisation might look cluttered as two diagrams of box and whiskers plot were chunked into one. However, the comparison was necessary in visualing the transacted prices using the same x-axis.\n\nb\\. The numbers of the average transacted price labelled within each box and whisper plot were small and some of the numbers were cut out such as Apartment in both Land and Strata.\n\nc\\. Two outliers were eradicated as the box and whiskers plot appeared very narrowed. Thus the full spectrum of the outliers was not shown.\n```\n\n## Post Submission Add-On\n\nComing Soon.\n\n## **References**\n\nJones, B. (2012). Data Visualization: Clarity or Aesthetics.
